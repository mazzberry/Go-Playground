## Overview

The **Go Playground** repository encompasses a wide range of Go programming topics, including but not limited to:

- Basic and Composite Data Types
- Variables and Constants
- Control Structures (Loops, If-Else, Switch)
- Functions and Methods
- Interfaces and Type Embedding
- Error Handling

- Concurrency (Goroutines)

Each topic is encapsulated in its own directory, containing relevant Go files that demonstrate the concept in a clear and concise manner.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- `00.basicDataTypes/`
- `01.basicOperations/`
- `02.Values/`
- `03.Variables/`
- `04.Constants/`
- `05.Loops/`
- `06.If_else_Switch/`
- `10.Functions/`

- `12.Methods/`
- `13.Interface/`
- `14.TypeEmbeding/`
- `15.ErrorHandling/`
- `16.Conversion/`
- `17.Concurrency/`
