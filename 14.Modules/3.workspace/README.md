create work space

![alt text](image-1.png)

it'll create a file that named go.work <br>

In "go.work" we can specify a specific version of a module to use in development
<br>

while we using go workSpace, should describe our module too. see (line: 4)
<br>

<h3>SOME NOTES:</h3> <br>
1- better be using go.work in Development phase (send it to gitignore)

Do not use the workspace for this run of the file (it will not use the workspace temporarily) 

##this command only works in bash, not cmd or pws
